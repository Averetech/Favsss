        Reading brings benefits like expanding your mind and boosting
        creativity. Books provide an escape from stress, promoting relaxation
        and mental well-being. Participating in book clubs can make reading an
        exciting social activity.

          I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I started to do it when I was
          seven years old with the help of my grandmother. She was able to
          interest me and always helped me when I had some difficulties. The
          first time I did it, I felt interested. So I kept reading.
